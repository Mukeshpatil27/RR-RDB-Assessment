Codecademy Learners Mockup Data


First, use SELECT * from both tables and use your knowledge of queries and aggregate functions to get to know the data:

What are the Top 25 schools (.edu domains)?
How many .edu learners are located in New York?
The mobile_app column contains either mobile-user or NULL. How many of these Codecademy learners are using the mobile app?


Join the two tables using JOIN and then see what you can dig out of the data!

Do different schools (.edu domains) prefer different courses?
What courses are the New Yorkers students taking?
What courses are the Chicago students taking?
